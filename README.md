# find-care
CodeClan solo project utilising Ruby/Sinatra/PostgreSQL. A web app for helping people with disabilities find appropriate carers depending upon their budget. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BACKGROUND

The Social Care (Self Directed Support)(Scotland) Act 2014 allows individuals who receive care paid for by their local council
to: Be told what their individual care budget is; and, take control of their budget, if they are capable. 

Individuals can choose to employ a care agency, or, if they wish, employ one or more support workers directly. The aim of the app is to make the process of employing a support worker easier.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT THE APP DOES

Both service users, and potential support workers, can create their own account. 

A support worker must specify the types of care experience they have and their hourly rate, before being approved by the site admin.

A service user specifies their weekly budget when they create an account. They can search for potential support workers by specific criteria or by keyword. They are told how many hours they are able to afford and are able to request timeslots from the worker. The worker sees that a request has been made when they log in to their account and they can confirm if they are able to do the visit. 

The service user's account shows how much of their weekly budget they have used, and they are able to request visits until their budget has been filled. At any time they are able to cancel a visit. Visits recur on a weekly basis and service users and support workers are shown their timetable on their account homepage. A service user can have multiple workers and similarly a worker can support multiple service users.

The web layout is designed with the disabled user in mind and attempts to correspond to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 ( https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/ )
