CARE FINDER FOR DISABLED PEOPLE 

A web app for helping people with disabilities find appropriate care depending upon their budget. 

MVP

A client (disabled person) can create, edit and delete a user account. They are able to search the database of support workers (carers) by filtering by specific criteria. 

The client can book support workers and their budget is subsequently reduced, depending on the number of hours they have booked and the cost of the support worker.

The user interface should be designed with accessibility in mind (e.g. for people that might be using screen readers etc.)

EXTENSION 1

The client interface should allow for a disabled person having a recurring budget (e.g. if they receive Â£1000 every month towards care). It should calculate what workers a client is able to continuously have without running out of money. For example, a client may be able to afford a more expensive worker for 12 hours a week, or a cheaper worker for 20 hours a week. 

A support worker can create a worker account. They list their hourly cost, number of hours of availability and the types of care experience they have. A message tells them if they are subsequently booked by a client.

EXTENSION 2

Clients are able to choose the specific hours of the week (e.g. 7am-9am Mondays) that they require care, and worker accounts consequently must specify the hours they are available. Clients are then able to filter their search for workers according to these hours.

If a worker is booked for a specific time-slot they are unable to be booked by another client for that slot. 

EXTENSION 3

Clients are able to give each support worker a rating out of 5 stars. The average of these ratings is displayed on the worker's profile. Additionally, a client can search based upon this filter.
